# DQNs
My implementations of some DQN algorithms
* All implementations are written in pytorch
* The algorithms are implemented as classes
* All implementations are encapsulated in a single file
* The algorithms take OpenAI gym envs as inputs

### Algorithms: 
 - [x] DQN [^]
 - [x] DDQN [^]
 - [x] Dueling DQN [^]
 - [ ] PER DQN [^]
 - [ ] Noisy DQN [^]
