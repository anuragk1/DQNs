# DQNs
My implementations of some DQN algorithms
* All implementations are written in pytorch
* The algorithms are implemented as classes
* All implementations are encapsulated in a single file
* The algorithms take OpenAI gym envs as inputs

 - [x] DQN [^1]
 - [x] DDQN [^2]
 - [x] Dueling DQN [^3]
 - [ ] PER DQN [^4]
 - [ ] Noisy DQN [^5]
